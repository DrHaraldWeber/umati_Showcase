# How to display a software product in the umati.app

You are a software vendor, who creates and markets dashboarding or similiar applications.
Then you can showcase you products also through the umati.app.

Going forward we will created software products as a separate listing inside the umati.app.
So a user of the app, will not only be able to browse connected machines but also software solutions.

What informations will be provided to a prospect:

- **Manufacturer**
- URL of the manufacturer/product site
- **Productname**
- URL of a running product instance (accessible demonstration instance, connected to the datahub, - showcaseing the connected machines)
- Software icon
- Software screenshot (min 1024x768px)
- Short description of the product (1000 char)
- Fair location (hall / booth) multiple assignments in the future

For the [METAV digital](https://metav-digital.de) (23.-26.03.2021) this list will be filled manual by the fair organizer, after you provide the information and are registered for the fair.

This list will be selfmanagable going forward.
